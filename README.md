# The Sourdough Framework (WIP)

The sourdough framework is an open source book dedicated to
helping you to make the best possible sourdough bread at home.
Rather than providing recipes this book intends to provide a
framework that enables you to bake bread in your individual
environment. Every flour, every sourdough and every home setup
is different. This makes making sourdough bread at home so hard.
Say no more, this book will help you to master making bread in
your environment.

## Motivation


4 years after launching [the-bread-code repo](https://github.com/hendricius/the-bread-code)
and the [pizza-dough repo](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough)
I present to you The Sourdough Framework book.  When not
working as a software engineer I teach people how to bake bread on
[my YouTube channel.](https://youtube.com/c/thebreadcode) Several
people have asked me to offer a written down version of my teachings.
I believe that knowledge like this is essential to everyone.
That's why I decided to open source my knowledge hoping
that it will reach more people all over the world without
budget constrains.
