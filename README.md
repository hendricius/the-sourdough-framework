# The Sourdough Framework

The sourdough framework is an open-source book dedicated to
helping you to make the best possible sourdough bread at home.

![The book cover](book/images/cover-page.jpg)

Rather than providing recipes this book intends to provide a
framework that enables you to bake bread in your respective
environment. Every flour, every sourdough, and every home setup
is different. This makes following recipes without background
information so hard and a fail-prone endeavor. This book
intends to close that gap.

## Background

4 years after launching the repositories [the-bread-code](https://github.com/hendricius/the-bread-code)
and [pizza-dough](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough) I
created this project to merge the knowledge together. This
project intends to go one step deeper into the workings of
natural fermentation. At the same time as many scientific references
as possible are provided.
