# The Sourdough Framework

The sourdough framework is an open-source book dedicated to
helping you to make the best possible sourdough bread at home.

![The book cover](book/cover/cover-page.jpg)

Rather than providing recipes this book intends to provide a
framework that enables you to bake bread in your respective
environment. Every flour, every sourdough, and every home setup
is different. This makes following recipes without background
information so hard and a fail-prone endeavor. This book
intends to close that gap.

## Background

4 years after launching the repositories [the-bread-code](https://github.com/hendricius/the-bread-code)
and [pizza-dough](https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough) I
created this project to merge the knowledge together. This
project intends to go one step deeper into the workings of
natural fermentation. At the same time as many scientific references
as possible are provided.

## üçû Baking the book (Docker)

```console
make
```

Then you can check out the file `book/book.pdf`

If you want to üçû bake all the versions including ebook variants (.pdf, .epub
in colour and size optimized Black&White), run:

```console
make bake
```

You can check the files in  the folder `book/release/`

## üçû Baking the book locally (LaTeX)

Make sure you have `biber`, `latexmk` and ``ImageMagick`` installed. Refer to
your system's installation instructions for LaTeX. To create the serif .pdf
format, run:

```console
cd book/
make
```

If you want to üçû bake all the versions including ebook variants (.pdf, .epub
in colour and size optimized Black&White, as well as website), run:

```console
cd book/
make -j bake
```

You can check the files in the folder `book/release/`

You can get some help on building various versions with:

```console
cd book/
make help
```
## Compiled versions

The below versions are automatically built on every push to the `main` branch.

* [Download compiled .pdf version](https://www.the-bread-code.io/book.pdf)
* [Download compiled .epub version](https://www.the-bread-code.io/book.epub)

There's an additional enhanced accessibility version using a sans-serif font:

* [Download compiled sans-serif .pdf version](https://www.the-bread-code.io/book-sans-serif.pdf)

An additional black and white ebook is provided with a greatly reduced file
size. This shrinks the book from more than 20MB down to ~5MB:

* [Download compiled B&W .epub version](https://www.the-bread-code.io/bw-book.epub)

For those who prefer a concise reference (about 15 pages), we offer a "too long;didn't read" (TL;DR)
version. This condensed guide contains the essential flowcharts, crucial information,
and space for your notes - perfect for quick kitchen reference.
It provides the key information you need without reading the complete book.

* [Read TL;DR version on your device](https://the-bread-code.io/book-tldr-print.pdf)
* [Download TL;DR version for printing](https://the-bread-code.io/book-tldr-digital.pdf)

We recommend using double-sided printing if your printer supports it.

## Online HTML version

Head over to [https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com)

To build the website make sure to have the ruby version installed specified in
`website/.ruby-version`.
