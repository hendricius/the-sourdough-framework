This book would not have been possible without your help.

With all your donations I have been able to take time off from my job and
focus on this project.

Furthermore many of you have contributed and improved the
instructions, fixed spelling mistakes and/or provided
feedback on the content. Each of you has made this book
better.

By providing this book free of charge,
we can enable more people around the world to bake delicious sourdough
bread at home.

Thank you very much for your support!\\
