Crumb texture & Unbaked gummy areas towards the bottom of the bread.
              & Crumb can be perceived as gummy as most gluten broken down.
              & Crumb evenly baked. Crumb can be perceived as moist, but not gummy.
              \\ 
Alveoli       & Overly large alveoli in the crumb ``craters''.
              & Many tiny alveoli equally distributed.
              & Alveoli evenly distributed, no ``craters''.
              \\ 
Taste         & Pale neutral taste.
              & Strong acidic flavor profile. Acidity overweighs when tasting.
              & Balanced flavor profile, not too mild but also not too sour.
              Depending on starter vinegary or lactic notes.
              \\ 
Texture       & Overall poor texture.
              & Good consistency, crumb is not as fluffy as it could be.
              & Great combination of  textures.
              \\ 
Oven spring   & Vertical oven spring, mostly due to water evaporating and inflating the dough.
              & Very flat pancake like  structure after baking.
              & Great vertical oven spring. Dough grows more upwards rather than sideways.
