\midrule
Room temperature                          & The easiest option. Best for bread that is eaten within a day.
                                            Crust typically stays crisp when humidity not too high.
                                          & Bread dries out very quickly.\\

Room temperature in airtight container    & Good for up to a week.
                                          & Bread needs to be toasted for crust to become crisp again. Catches mold more quickly\\

Fridge                                    & Bread stays good for weeks. Can dry out a little bit when not using air-tight container.
                                          & Bread needs to be toasted. Requires fridge and energy.\\

Freezer                                   & Bread stays good for years.
                                          & Requires thawing and then toasting. Requires freezer and energy.\\
